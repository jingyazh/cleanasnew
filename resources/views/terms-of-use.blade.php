          <h2><b> Legal Disputes</b></h2>
          <p><b> PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND CANGC HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.</b></p>
          <p><b> You and CANGC agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or may arise between us relating in any way to or arising out of this or previous versions of our Terms, your use of or access to the Website, or any products or Website sold or purchased through the Website, will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Legal Disputes section.</b></p>
          <hr>
          <p>Choice of Law.<br>
            This Agreement is made under and will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Claim Limitations. <br>
            You agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Website must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Agreement to Arbitrate</p>
          <p>You and CANGC each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and CANGC relating in any way to or arising out of this or previous versions of this Agreement, your use of or access to CANGC 's Website, or any products or Website sold, offered, or purchased through our Website will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</p>
          <p>The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS Arbitration ("JAMS") under its applicable rules and procedures, as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The arbitration will be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes.</p>
          <p>Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator and not a judge or jury. You understand that arbitration procedures can be more limited that rules applicable in court. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review in court.</p>
          <p>You and we must abide by the following rules: (a) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (b) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF, (c) the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (d) the arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (e) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (f) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and then in such instance, the fees and costs awarded will be determined by the applicable law.</p>
          <p>With the exception of subparts (a) and (b) in the paragraph above (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, either subpart (a) or (b) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void, and neither you nor we will be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute will be exclusively brought in state or federal court in the Court of Chancery, Delaware.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2><b>General</b></h2>
          <p>Changes to Agreement. <br>
            This Agreement is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes, we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us (if any) and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our Site.
